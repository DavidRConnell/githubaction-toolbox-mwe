# MWE toolbox

A minimal toolbox to demonstrate use of Github Actions and recent MATLAB tools to build and release MATLAB toolboxes in an open, automated, and reproducible manner.

This repository aims to demonstrate:

- [ ] Testing code on multiple OSes using Github Actions.
- [ ] Exporting livescripts as HTML to be used in online documentation.
- [ ] Publishing online documentation using Github Pages and hugo.
- [ ] Building mex files using cmake.
- [ ] Compiling toolboxes into the mltbx format.
- [ ] Automating release of toolboxes built by Github Actions to the file exchange.
